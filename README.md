# Visualizing-World-Economic-Trends
A group project that focused on visualizing gobal economics, and its relationship with healthcare, technology and the environment. My responsibility was to use pandas to clean the data, and construct all bar charts and pie charts to display basic economic facts and the relationship to urban population growth and economic sectors, economic growth, as well as unemployment. My team drilled down into some more data and displayed some interesting information on technology, the environment and healthcare.

The questions I concerned myself with are the following:
Which regions of the world have the highest economic impact?
Which regions have the highest growth forecast? 
How does economic size affect the unemployment rate?
How do different industries of an economy affect urban population growth?
