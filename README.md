Visualizing World Economic Trends


Is there a correlation between the percentage of a countryâ€™s GDP spent on healthcare and life expectancy for men and women?

It appears that for the countries that spend approximately 4% to 8% of their GDP on healthcare most men and women lived to be about 75 to 80 years old.
However, the countries that spent 10% to 12% saw the greatest life expectancy at 85 years. Only a couple countries such as the United States spend about 16% of their GDP on healthcare and only gain a marginal improvement in life expectancy at about 83 years old.
